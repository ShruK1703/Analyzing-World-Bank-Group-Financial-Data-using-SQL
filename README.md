Analyzing World Bank Group Financial Data using SQL

Being from the economics world, I was excited to explore and analyze the dataset related to this field. I read a lot of current affairs about how the world bank helps in the development of countries by giving credit. There were so many questions in my mind about how the Indian government or any government is dependent upon the credits of the World Bank and which sector is highly influenced by it.
So, this led me to explore the dataset using Structured Query Language(SQL) to access the data and find insights about the loans and credit given to the countries.

Source of the Data:
The World Bank Group (WBG) is a family of 5 International Organizations. One of them is the International Development Association (IDA), established in 1960, which provides concessional financing (interest-free loans or grants), usually with sovereign guarantees. So, I have scraped the IDA Statement Of Credits and Grants - Historical Data updated on 17th December 2022 from the website of the World Bank Group Finances where data is open and accessible to all.

After exploring the dataset of above 1 million rows and 137 countries and focusing on mainly a single country that is India, I have come up with a few questions:

Q1. What are the top 5 countries with the highest borrowing from the World Bank?

Q2. What are the top 5 countries with the least borrowing from the World Bank?

Q3. Which Region has the most borrowing?

Q4. What is the total number of Projects that India needed credits on or borrowed from WBG?

Q5. What is the name of the Project that borrowed the most?

Q6. What is the name of the Project that borrowed the least?

Q7. What is the total sum of funding and the average amount that was lent to India?

Q8. What is the average amount that was repaid by India?

Q9. Who is the borrower from India and what is the most/least amount borrowed by India?

Q10. What is the total number of Projects that have been repaid?

CONCLUSION
By far, after analyzing the complete dataset, I have come to the conclusion that the World Bank Group has given an exemplary amount of credit to 137 countries for the development in various sectors such as rural upliftment, education, health, etc. and the South Asian Region has accepted most of it.
I have chosen my country that is India and its information about credit status.
So, as per my analysis, there are a total of 454 projects from India that have been running on World Bank credits, and the National Rural Livelihood Project has borrowed the most for the upliftment of people living in rural areas in the country. After looking deep into the dataset, I got to know that India has still repaying the dues, even after the deadline has crossed which means the End of the Period was 30 June 2022.
India has paid back less than the half of average amount of funding. Statistically, it means India is in debt under the World Bank Group.

This is my first portfolio project and it has been such a great experience working on it. It helped me to enhance my skills and I hope, it also helps other aspiring data analysts.
Thank you!
